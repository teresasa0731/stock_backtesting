# stock_backtesting
This is an experimental project, used to learn stock strategies and other knowledge.

## Environment
It can be run directly locally, but I personally recommend setting up a virtual environment for this project.    
1. About how to create a virtual environment: https://docs.python.org/zh-tw/3.13/library/venv.html

2. start virtual environment
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install required packages
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. (for jupyter notebook)
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
